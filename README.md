# Tic-Tac-Toe Game with "Stupid" AI!
__Key Skills Involved: __ *MVVM, Sets, TapGesture, Alerts(to be updated for iOS15), GeometryReader.*

This will be one of my small side projects to work on off serious large projects.

Here, I'll try to build a iOS [Tic-tac-toe game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe) with SwiftUI in Xcode. 

I will also be implementing a somewhat 'stupid' hard-coded AI to play against human.
